First I click the link that is send to create Github account.
after entering the account I clicked on create new account which we can find under login account.
after that it ask me my email, password, username.
then I write my email, password, username.
then it asked me my permission to verify your github identity ,know which resources I can access and so 
after that I join the classroom and find my name.
It say you're ready to go and put the assignment and note link.
So I clicked it and see the note about git and github and the assignment.
after reading the assignment I start to do my assignment.
And to make the assignment easier I take screenshots after ever step.
